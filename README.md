# SMART_HOME Project Description

This repository contains the following key components for the SMART_HOME project:

## 1. SMART_HOME.ipynb

The `SMART_HOME.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook presents important research results and graphs to be used in the final report and research paper. It includes the following result graphs:

(a) **Comparison between AES and RSA Encryption Algorithms**:
    This section showcases a detailed comparison between the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption algorithms. The analysis justifies the selection of AES as the preferred encryption algorithm for the proposed SMART_HOME system, considering factors such as performance, security, and suitability.

(b) **Gas Cost on Ethereum Chain for Result Verification and Result Receiving Smart Contracts**:
    In this section, we analyze the gas costs associated with deploying and executing the Result Verification Smart Contract (RVC) and the Result Receiving Smart Contract (RRC) on the Ethereum blockchain. Understanding the gas costs is essential for optimizing the system's efficiency.

(c) **Comparing Transaction Costs for Different Environments**:
    This part of the notebook compares the transaction costs involved in deploying our smart contracts on various blockchain environments. By evaluating different platforms, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc., we aim to identify the most cost-efficient environment for deploying the proposed SMART_HOME system.

## 2. Architecture and Flow Diagram Folder

The `Architecture and Flow Diagram` folder contains PNG images that visually represent the architecture and flow diagrams for the proposed SMART_HOME system. These diagrams provide a clear overview of the system's design, components, and data flow, facilitating a better understanding of its functionalities.

## 3. Algorithm of RVC and RRC PDF

The `Algorithm of RVC and RRC.pdf` file contains algorithmic implementations for the Result Verification Smart Contract (RVC) and Result Receiving Smart Contract (RRC). These algorithms ensure privacy-preserving mechanisms within the SMART_HOME system and follow the guidelines for publication in IEEE research papers.

## 4. Reference Paper - "Privacy Preserving Mechanism in Smart Home Using Blockchain"

We have included the reference paper titled "Privacy Preserving Mechanism in Smart Home Using Blockchain." This paper serves as a foundational source for our research and implementation, providing valuable insights into utilizing blockchain technology for enhancing privacy in automated home systems.
